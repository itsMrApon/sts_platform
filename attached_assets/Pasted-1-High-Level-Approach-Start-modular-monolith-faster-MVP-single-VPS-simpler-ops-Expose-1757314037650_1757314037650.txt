1. High-Level Approach
   • Start modular monolith: faster MVP, single VPS, simpler ops.
   • Expose single public API per tenant/brand (GraphQL/REST) behind API Gateway.
   • Core infra shared: Postgres, Redis, MinIO/S3, message bus.
   • Modularized by domain: Commerce, Procurement/Manufacturing, Agency/SaaS, CMS.
   • Future-ready: modules can evolve into microservices.

2. Recommended Core Stack

Layer
Options / Recommendations
API Gateway
Traefik / Nginx (Docker), per-brand subdomains, rate limiting
Identity & RBAC
Keycloak (OIDC/OAuth2, SSO), tenants = organizations
frontend + dashboard
NestJS uploaded in vercel needs to connect the api
Backend
NestJS (Node/TypeScript, Prisma/TypeORM)
Database
PostgreSQL 16: schema-per-tenant (strong isolation)
Cache & Queue
Redis (cache, pub/sub, rate-limiting), optional RabbitMQ/Redpanda/Kafka
Object Storage
MinIO (local, S3 compatible) → can swap Cloudflare R2/S3
Search
Meilisearch or OpenSearch for products/orders/vendors
CMS
Directus / Strapi (Postgres, Keycloak SSO)
ERP
erpnext (Procurement, Manufacturing, Stock, Accounts), integrate via webhooks/REST

3. Tenancy Model
   • Tenant = project/legal entity (SudoTechServe, SwitchToSwag, StrongTermStrategy)
   • Optional child tenants per operator/location.
   • Organization → Users, Roles, Locations, Channels.
   • Role templates: Owner, Admin, Finance, Ops, Procurement, Warehouse, Designer, Agent, Vendor, Client.
   • Enforce RLS or schema isolation for multi-tenancy.

⸻

4. Domain Modules

4.1 Procurement (STS)(strongtermstrategy)
• Use Case: this is the producremnt service where client can see and order a bulk or regular quantity products from client location like from america to bangladesh with our usa source(my friend), to bangladesh ,usa from china source(my friend)
• Entities: Vendors, RFQ, Quotes, PO, Contracts, Incoterms, Shipments, QC, Invoices
• Flow: RFQ → Quote → Approve → PO → Production → Shipment → GRN → 3-way match
• Dashboards: Pipeline view, supplier scorecards, landed cost, exceptions

4.2 Manufacturing (STS)(strongtermstrategy)
• Use Case: this is the manufacaturing service where client can have the products (clothing like knit,) and find the sourceing like different fabric, pattern, layer for productions , cost calculation and finnaly buyer can place and work order for the production and he will get FOB shipment.
• Entities: BOM, Routing, Work Orders, Lots, Machines, Labor, Scrap, Yield
• Flow: Demand → MRP → WO → Issue materials → QC → Finished goods → Putaway
• Dashboards: Capacity load, WIP aging, OEE, cost variance
• Custom production planning flow (bulk orders, clothing-focused): 1. Select fabric (source, composition, GSM, dyeing/finishing options) 2. Select pattern (base pattern by size set) 3. Edit pattern (fit adjustments, allowances, grading) 4. Select layout/marker (size ratio, fabric width) 5. Edit layout (marker efficiency, waste optimization) 6. Print/AMBO (pattern/marker printout or automated marking & bundling ops) 7. Accessories (threads, labels, trims, packaging) 8. Finishing (wash/press, QC, packing) 9. FOB (incoterms, port/airport, shipment plan) 10. Final rate calculation (roll-up: material + labor + overhead + margin)
• Buyer portal (bulk order): configure → estimate cost in real-time → submit RFQ/PO → production tracking → shipment → GRN → 3-way match
~
Custom backend needs:
• Multi-country sourcing automation (e.g., auto-routing shipments from USA/China → BD)
• Integration with friends/partners’ stock systems if external suppliers don’t connect via standard ERPNext APIs
• Custom dashboard or visualization for advanced landed cost and exceptions
• Advanced workflow triggers (like automatic purchase orders when thresholds are met across multiple warehouses)
~
~
intrigated with erpnext for erp of the stock and calculate the step to production and priceing for each step, accounts for the income of the system (strongtermsstrategy)
